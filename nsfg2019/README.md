Create visualizations with National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) data.

Some months back, a client I was working for wanted information on youth risk factors associated with HIV. They wanted a sense of the kinds of broad social factors that may impact exposure to HIV or affect the lives of youth living with HIV. I settled on the National Survey of Family Growth as a good source of information. It is a nationally representative survey that is well designed and has been implemented for several cycles over many years. Finally, the data is well curated and there is years of documentation to accompany the survey's data. 

This repository describes my use of the data from the 2017-2019 cycle of the NSFG to characterize broad HIV risk factors. Initially, I created a dashboards in Tableau for the client, but in the below, I wanted duplicate those dashboards using a javascript library, **D3.js** as a learning exercise. This repository contains data I downloaded from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Health Statistics, the clean data files I produced and other documentation that led to the final product.
